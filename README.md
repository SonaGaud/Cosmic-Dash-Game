# Cosmic Dash Game 

Cosmic Dash is a simple arcade-style game developed using Pygame, where players navigate a spaceship through a field of asteroids, aiming to survive for as long as possible without colliding with any obstacles to achieve the highest score.

1. Controls:
   1. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the spaceship horizontally.
   2. Click anywhere on the screen to restart the game after a collision.
   3. The game displays the time elapsed since starting the game as the current score.
   4. The game keeps track of the high score, which represents the longest survival time achieved in previous game sessions.
   5. The high score is saved in a file named high_score.txt.
